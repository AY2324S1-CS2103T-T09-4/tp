### Project: TAvigator

TAs sometimes have many tutorial groups to manage, it could be chaotic to manage the attendance and work submission of
each individual student. TAvigator aims to provide a one-stop platform for National University of Singapore
Computer Science modulesâ€™ Teaching Assistants (TAs) to keep track of the work submission and attendance of each student
via a contact management application.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
