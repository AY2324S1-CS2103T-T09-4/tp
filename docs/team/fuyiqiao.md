### Project: TAvigator

TAs sometimes have many tutorial groups to manage, it could be chaotic to manage the attendance and work submission of
each individual student. TAvigator aims to provide a one-stop platform for National University of Singapore
Computer Science modulesâ€™ Teaching Assistants (TAs) to keep track of the work submission and attendance of each student
via a contact management application.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the tallied attendance feature
  * What it does: Displays a simple summary of the number of tutorials the student attended and missed. 
  * Justification: Allows the tutor to view at a glance which students have been consistently missing lessons, so that they can take the necessary actions. The main goal of easy access was also why we did not choose to implement this feature as a separate command.
  * Highlights: The implementation of this feature was fairly straightforward, but required vigorous testing to ensure that the outputs were correct and displayed with the proper formatting.
* **New Feature**: Added the merge command
  * What it does: Merges two the information of two students. The new student has the name, email, phone number and student id of the primary student. The tags and attendance records of both students are now owned by the new student. 
  * Justification: Allows the tutor to merge duplicated contacts, so that the there is no case of the tutor recording attendance under the wrong student. 
  * Highlights: The implementation of this feature was tricky in that I had to make sure that there are no duplicated records after merging the two students.
