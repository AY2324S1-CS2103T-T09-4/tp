# Project: TAvigator

### Overview

**TAvigator**Â streamlines the teaching process for TAs around the world. Our software understands the various roles a TA has to play, from meticulous record-keeping to fostering connections with students.

Tavigator is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAvigator can get your lesson management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
