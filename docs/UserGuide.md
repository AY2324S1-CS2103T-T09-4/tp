TAvigator is a **desktop app** targeted towards Teaching Assistants **for managing contacts, optimized for use via a 
Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type 
fast, TAvigator can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. We offer a one-stop
solution to manage your student details, including attendance records and assignment details.

## 2. Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
**:bulb: Tip:** **Not sure how to check your Java version?**
**Step 1.** Open up **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac and Linux).

**Step 2.** Type and run the command `java -version`.

**Step 3.** Check the version number provided (`xxx`) is at least `11`.

An example is shown below.

  ```
  > java -version
  java version "xxx" <Other information>
  ```
</div>

2. Download the latest `tavigator.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TAvigator.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tavigator.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list students` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/Fu Yiqiao p/91234567 e/fyq@gmail.com id/A1234567E t/G10` : Adds a contact named `Fu Yiqiao` to TAvigator.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/G01` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `|` indicate that the command accepts either parameters.<br>
  e.g `mark n/STUDENTNAME | id/STUDENTID` takes in `STUDENTNAME` or `STUDENTID` as its first argument.

* Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as many times as desired (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## 5. FAQ

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAvigator home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
